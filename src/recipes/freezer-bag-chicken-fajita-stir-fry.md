## Directions

1. Whisk together the oil, chili powder, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and several grinds black pepper in a large microwave-safe bowl. Add the garlic, peppers and onion and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and microwave until the vegetables are crisp-tender, about 2 minutes. Remove the plastic wrap and let cool completely.
2. Transfer the vegetables with the marinade to a large resealable plastic bag and add the chicken. Squeeze out most of the air and seal, then toss gently to coat the chicken with the marinade. Freeze until ready to use. Let thaw in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours before cooking. 
3. Pour the chicken, vegetables and marinade into a large skillet and heat over high heat. Cook, stirring often, until the chicken is cooked through, about 12 minutes. Season with salt and pepper.
4. Divide the chicken and vegetables among 4 plates. Serve with 3 tortillas each and the guacamole, salsa, sour cream and lime wedges on the side.

### Cook’s Note

Steam corn tortillas in the microwave so they stay pliable and don't split under the weight of taco fillings. Wrap a stack of tortillas in damp paper towels or a damp kitchen towel, then wrap in plastic wrap or place in a microwave-safe resealable plastic bag (keep the bag open to vent). Microwave until warm and flexible, about 1 minute.
