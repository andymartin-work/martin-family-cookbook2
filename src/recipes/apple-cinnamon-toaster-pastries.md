### **Instructions**

1. Make pastry dough. Mix flour, xantham gum, salt, baking pawder and confectioner's sugar in large bowl until well combined.
2. Add diced butter and blend until small peas of butter wrapped in flour
3. Add ice-cold milk and stir to combine. Wear food prep gloves and squeeze with hands until able to form dough ball. Handle as little as possible to not melt butter. Add 1 tablespoon of ice cold milk if dough does not hold. 
4. Wrap dough ball in plastic wrap and place in refrigerator. Chill for 30 mins or overnight.
5. In medium saucepan place apples, vanillla, salt, cinammon, 2 tablespoons water. Stir to combine. Cook over medium-high heat about 10 minutes, stir frequently until apples very soft. 
6. Remove saucepan from heat and stir in brown sugar and cornstarch. Stir until sugar and cornstarch are dissolved with no lumps.
7. Preheat oven to 400F. Line baking sheets with parchment paper and set aside.
8. Place dough between two large sheets of plastic wrap. Roll dough between plastic wrap until it is a rectangle 1/8 inch thick. Remove plastic wrap.
9. Be sure to remove plastic wrap. Cut the rectangle of dough into toaster sized pieces - two pieces together make one pastry. Divide filling evenly over half of the pieces but leave border about 1/2 inch from edges. Place other half of pastry pieces atop of the ones with filling. Seal the edges with the tines of a fork.
10. Place pastries on the lined baking sheets about 1 inch apart. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes, or until the pastries are lightly golden brown.
11. Serve immediately or freeze for toaster use.
